You got well trained by the TNP and you are attending an interview. The company is asking for atleast N number of certificates. You have the required number of certificates, but most of them went missing. You have only M number of certificates in your hand. You decided to search for the remaining certificates. How many certificates do you need to find. (If you are doing a coding problem for the first time, Remember that you should not output anything other than the given output format. i.e You should not output strings like "Enter your value", "The answer is...", just output the answer. In this question, you should just output the number of certificates you need to find.)
