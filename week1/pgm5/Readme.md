We are under the crisis of the major health disaster , COVID-19.

As a part of this , we need to update the current statistics of it (currently looking kerala only).

For this , we have the updated current data is

total => 5892 cases

Recovered => 3454

Death => 27

Current cases => 2411

[Datas are not real - ideal datas are being used here for easy calculations]

We need to keep on asking the amount of new cases and recovered , death count in each day and display the current statistics as shown above after collecting each day's information.

The statistics table showing should be continued when the current cases become zero..and give a message as "SAFE"

When the current cases become less than 0 , then the input data will be wrong , so at that time , print "WRONG"
